flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

	    can try to kill him/her without being flagged.

#
SAVE
Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

> save

STRING
For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

KICK
Fighters only.
The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned. The higher
level you reach the harder you kick. There is one small catch -- whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three 
rounds of 'Violence' -- so be sure that you do not need to flee!

Fighters See Also: Rescue, Bash
#
BASH

is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear. The victim will be
unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence. If you miss you loose
your balance and fall.
A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.
Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5*damage.
Fighters See Also : Rescue, Kick
#
RESCUE

Fighters Only.

This command is useful if you want to try and make an attacker hit you
instead of your poor friend who is being pummeled.  You can only 'turn'
one monster for each rescue attempt.  This is highly useful when playing
in groups, of course.

rescue <victim>

> rescue quifael
#
STEAL

Thief Only.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now illegal to steal from other
players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Example:

> steal gold drunk

> steal sword mercenary
  (only possible if he is sleeping)

#
BACKSTAB

Thief only.

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:

Levels	Multiplier
------  ----------
 1-7	    2
 8-13	    3
14-20	    4
21-30	    5

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild.  You can always backstab sleeping
people.

> junk cup
> junk all.bronze
> junk 500 coins

#
DONATE

#
SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

COMMANDS

You can only practise a certain amount for each level you gain, and you
do not have to save this, it can be accumulated.

have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#
BUG TYPO IDEA

> bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'

bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?

the room you are in; only the name of the room and the people and objects
there.  Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're travelling,
however, it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

See Also: GROUP
#
GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
