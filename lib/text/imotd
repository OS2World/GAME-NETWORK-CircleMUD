Welcome to CircleMUD 2.2!!

This is the immortal MOTD -- the file that immortals will see when they
log in to the game.

If you've just created a new god chracter, the first thing you should do
is RESTORE yourself -- i.e. type "restore <your name>" -- to set your
stats to maximum.

Also, when you get a chance, you should change this file, along with the
mortal MOTD, news, etc, to something more interesting...
