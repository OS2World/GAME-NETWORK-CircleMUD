           --- On the handling facilities for 'social actions'---


A general system exists to handle the 'social' commands, ie. commands that
have no game-related purpose save to convey emotions between players.
These are handled by the procedure

	void do_action(struct char_data *ch, char *argument, int cmd);

The text file lib/text/socials contains information on the game's socials.
New socials can be added by 1) adding the name of the social to the list of
recognized commands in interpreter.c; 2) adding a COMMANDO line to link
the new social to the function do_action; and 3) adding the information
for the new social in the lib/text/socials file.

The socials must be in strictly increasing order in the file.

The file is formatted as follows:

--------------------------------------------
<command number> <hide-flag> <minimum position of victim>
<messg to character if no argument>
<messg to others if no arg>                
<messg to char if victim found>           <---If this field is empty,
<messg to others if victim found>          <- 
<messg to victim>                            | then these fields must be
<messg to char if victim not found>          | skipped, and the action will
<messg to char if vict is char>              | ignore arguments.
<messg to others if vict is char>          <-

<command number> <hide-flag> <minimum position of victim>
.
.
.
.
.

-------------------------------------------------

A message must be contained in one line.

The hide-flag, if nonzero, makes the procedure hide the action from OTHERS,
if they cannot see the character. The action won't be hidden from the VICTIM,
even if he/she cannot see the character (the character's name will, of course,
be replaced with "someone").

Where it makes sense to do so, text fields may be left empty. This is done by
putting a '#' in the first column on the line. 
   This is permissible for the following fields:

a: messg to others if no arg
b: messg to others if victim found
c: messg to others if vict is char

NOTE again that if the field _messg to char if victim found_ is empty, then
the following fields must be omitted entirely (not even the '~'), and the
action will ignore any arguments supplied.

The procedure sends the text strings through act(), and they may contain
control codes (see the documentation for act() in comm.doc.  Note that not
all of act()'s control codes may be used.

In order to improve execution speed, no tests are made on the consistency of
the usage of these codes. Hence, grave disorder may be the result if, say,
the code '$N' occurs in a text field that doesn't naturally refer to a victim;
like _messg to others if no arg_.
