/*
Below are several constants which you can change to alter certain aspects
of the way CircleMUD acts.  Since this is a .c file, all you have to do
to change one of the constants (assuming you keep your object files around)
is change the constant in this file and type 'make'.  Make will recompile
this file and relink; you don't have to wait for the whole thing to recompile
as you do if you change a header file.

I realize that it would be slightly more efficient to have lots of
#defines strewn about, so that, for example, the autowiz code isn't
compiled at all if you don't want to use autowiz.  However, the actual
code for the various options is quite small, as is the computational time
in checking the option you've selected at run-time, so I've decided the
convenience of having all your options in this one file outweighs the
efficency of doing it the other way.

/* Some nameservers (such as the one here at JHU) are slow and cause the
   game to lag terribly every time someone logs in.  The lag is caused by
   the gethostbyaddr() function -- the function which resolves a numeric
   IP address (such as 128.220.13.30) into an alphabetic name (such as
   circle.cs.jhu.edu).

   The nameserver at JHU can get so bad at times that the incredible lag
   caused by gethostbyaddr() isn't worth the luxury of having names
   instead of numbers for players' sitenames.

   If your nameserver is fast, set the variable below to NO.  If your
   nameserver is slow, of it you would simply prefer to have numbers
   instead of names for some other reason, set the variable to YES.

   You can experiment with the setting of nameserver_is_slow on-line using
   the SLOWNS command from within the MUD.
